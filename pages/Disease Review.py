    **What can this app do?**
    This app allows users to initiate a comprehensive research process on specific diseases using CrewAI agents. The agents will collect, analyze, and compile information into a coherent review.
    
    **How to use the app?**
    1. Enter a disease name in the input field.
    2. Click the "Start Research" button to begin the process.
    3. The results will be displayed once the research is completed.
